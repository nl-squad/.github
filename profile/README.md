# 🎮 nl-squad

This is a GitHub organization for the NoLimits community. It was founded in 2011. Since then, we have developed dozens of mods (custom modifications) for a few games. NoLimits is proud to be the greatest CoD2 community and is still being visited by players who are mentioning our servers as a sentimental escape to the good old days.
